## Overview
The Task Manager is a simple web application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. 
It allows users to add, update, and delete tasks while saving data locally on the browser.

## Features
- **Add and Update Tasks**: Create new tasks or update existing ones with a title, date, and description.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list when no longer needed.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions.
- **Task Editing**: Edit tasks directly from the task list.
- **Responsive User Interface**: The task form can be toggled on and off, and a confirmation dialog appears when attempting to close the form with unsaved changes.
